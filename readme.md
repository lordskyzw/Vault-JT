# A vault implemented in software

This is as a vault I developed just to store bets for the Musk vs Zuck fight

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/lordskyzw/vault-jt.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`

## Usage

The application provides two routes:

- `/signup`: Allows users to sign up by providing their national ID, password, and a  phrase.
- `/login`: Allows users to log in by providing their national ID and password.

If the user provides valid credentials, they are redirected to a welcome page that displays their secret phrase.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! 
Listen, just like with most of my projects, I would appreciate help on the front end
